Malaria Prediction using Random Forest Machine Learning Model 

This notebook presents a machine learning project aimed at predicting malaria case severity using a Random Forest classifier. Here's my analysis of the project:

Key Components of the Project
1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
   - The dataset contains 1,054 entries with 12 columns
   - Features include year, plasmodium species, sample size, treatment failure metrics, and weather data (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
   - The target variable is "POSITIVE_DAY_3 (days)" which has been categorized into severity classes

2. Data Preprocessing
   - No missing values found (all columns have 1054 non-null entries)
   - Created a new categorical target variable "severity" with 3 classes:
     - Low (â‰¤15 days): 638 cases
     - Medium (16-30 days): 210 cases
     - High (>30 days): 206 cases

3. Feature Engineering
   - The severity classification was created by binning the continuous "POSITIVE_DAY_3" values
   - Features selected for modeling include year, plasmodium species, sample size, follow-up days, treatment failure metrics, and weather variables

Strengths of the Approach
1. Data Preparation
   - Clean dataset with no missing values
   - Created a clear classification problem from continuous data
   - Included diverse feature types (temporal, clinical, environmental)

2. Model Selection
   - Random Forest is well-suited for this type of classification problem because:
     - Handles mixed data types well (numeric and categorical)
     - Robust to outliers and non-linear relationships
     - Provides feature importance measures
     - Generally performs well without extensive hyperparameter tuning

Recommendations for Improvement

1. Feature Engineering
   - Consider normalizing/standardizing numeric features since they're on different scales
   - Explore creating interaction terms between weather variables and treatment metrics
   - Could extract month from year for seasonal analysis

2. Model Development
   - The current notebook shows data preparation but doesn't include the actual Random Forest implementation
   - Need to add:
     - Train/test split (though the split is mentioned in the code)
     - Model training code
     - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
     - Feature importance analysis
     - Hyperparameter tuning

3. Class Imbalance
   - The classes are imbalanced (638 Low vs 206 High)
   - Consider techniques like:
     - Class weighting in Random Forest
     - Oversampling minority classes
     - Using metrics like F1-score that account for imbalance

4. Additional Analysis
   - Include exploratory data analysis visualizations
   - Consider time-series aspects since data spans multiple years
   - Could experiment with other models (XGBoost, SVM) for comparison
